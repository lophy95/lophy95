### About 
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a **PhD Research Fellow** at IIT, Hyderabad, India. My research is aimed at answering the questions concerned with the formation of the universe and its existence today. To answer these questions we analyze the petabyte-scale data generated using the particle collider experiment Belle II in Japan.
- 🔭 I am involved in multiple physics analysis projects. Through my research, I have gained an excellent knowledge of statistical data analysis and computer programming in **C++**, **Python**, and **Linux**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Data Science and Machine learing** from Online courses (**Datacamp, Coursera**), **Kaggle** and reading books.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning**.
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [**Github** ](https://github.com/lophy95?tab=repositories).
- 📝 I write articles on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@lophy95).
